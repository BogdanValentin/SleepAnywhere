# Sleep Anywhere

The Sleep Anywhere mod is a convenient addition to Minecraft that allows players to sleep anywhere they want without the need for a bed. Whether you're exploring distant lands, delving into deep caves, or simply caught out in the wilderness at night, this mod lets you rest on the go.

## Features

- **Singleplayer and Multiplayer compatible**: Both the server and client need to have the mod installed. The config of the server takes priority.

- **Configurable Key Binding**: You can configure the key binding for sleeping according to your preference. By default, press 'M' to sleep.

- **Debuffs for Balance**: To maintain game balance and prevent abuse, the mod introduces configurable debuffs when sleeping. These debuffs include:
    - Hunger
    - Nausea
    - Blindness
    - Darkness
    - Mining Fatigue
    - Weakness
    - Slowness

## Configuration

You can customize the effects of the Sleep Anywhere mod through its configuration file (located in .minecraft/config/sleepanywhere-config):
- **Debuffs**: Adjust the duration of debuffs applied when sleeping, or disable them entirely if desired (by setting them to 0).
